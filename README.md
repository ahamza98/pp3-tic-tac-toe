## Bugs

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ------- | ------- |
| Was not able to print out the winner| Make winner variable global under check win |
| When choosing to play again, game would end again straight away, meaning whoever won last round won again without playing. | Set game_running to false under play_again_option == 1 |
| User was able to overwrite the previous players choice. e.g if player_o picked position 1, player_x would be able to pick position 1. | Make the valid inputs global first, then remove the previous position using .remove() |
| Trailing white spaces all over the code | Go to VSCode settings and remove trailing auto whitespaces |
